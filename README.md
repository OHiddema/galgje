First steps to get a working concept:

- Put an input box on the page where the user enters the word to be guessed.
- Dynamiccaly add 26 clickable elements on the page (A..Z).
- When the user clicks, for example, element E, check for occurences of the letter E
  in the word to be guessed, an write the position(s) of this letter to the console.

Step 2:

- After the word to be guessed is entered, dynamiccaly create n elements,
  where n is the number of letters in the word to be guesed.
  These elements will be filled later with the letters that have been guessed correctly.

Step 3:
- When A..Z is clicked, the positions found in step 1 nust be filled in 'fillWord'

Step 4:
- Count the number of wrong guesses and display that number.
